# This rule is not used by the project kubeftpd itself.
# It is provided to allow the cluster admin to help manage permissions for users.
#
# Grants permissions to create, update, and delete resources within the ftp.golder.org.
# This role is intended for users who need to manage these resources
# but should not control RBAC or manage permissions for others.
